# **Intergalactic Pack**

Intergalactic Pack is a Minecraft modpack using the Fabric mod loader. This pack adds optimizations and more blocks to make building more enjoyable. There are some other miscellaneous things thrown in as well.

#### This pack is designed for my personal server with some friends. Feel free to use it or fork it for your own needs.

* [Intergalactic Pack]() is the (mostly) barebones version of the pack with all of the content mods needed to join a server. 
* [Intergalactic Pack Overloaded]() has these same mods plus some extra QOL stuff and the default configuration I like to use. It is still compatible with a server running the barebones pack.

### See [server.txt](https://github.com/J164/intergalactic-pack/blob/main/server.txt) for the list of mods needed to run a dedicated server.

## **Please do not report bugs to mod authors!**

Many problems that may arise while playing modpacks are due to compatibility problems between mods. It will be a lot more helpful both to you and to mod authors to initially report bugs encountered while playing this modpack to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/J164/intergalactic-pack/issues). Only after a bug is found to be due to a problem in a particular mod, it is appropriate to report it to that mod's issue tracker.
